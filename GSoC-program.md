### Project Summary

Working with the OMOP CDM (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model) involves handling large datasets that require a set of tools for extracting the necessary data efficiently. The first part of the project focuses on improving JuliaHealth's infrastructure by increasing the range of tools available to users. This involves enabling connections to various databases, and working with observational health data. Our second goal is to leverage the capacity built in the previous phase to develop a comprehensive framework for patient-level prediction. This framework will predict patient cohort outcomes with given treatments and will be tested on the mimic iii data, and potentially on real aggregated and anonymized patient data. 

This Jupyter notebook shows the flow of creating a prediction model from OMOP CDM using developed packages through the program. You can find it on juliahealth website - the tutorial section.
